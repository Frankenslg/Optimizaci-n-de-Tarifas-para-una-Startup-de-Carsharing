# 🚀 **Optimizing Carsharing Rates: A Dynamic Web Application**

## 🌐 **Interactive Data Exploration with Streamlit**

This project involves the development of an interactive web application using Streamlit, designed to empower users with visual data exploration of car sales advertisements.

---

## 🛠️ **Step 1: Getting Started**

### 🔧 **Laying the Foundation**
- **GitHub and Render.com Accounts:** Set up accounts on these platforms to host the project repository and streamline app deployment.
- **Environment Configuration:** Establish a virtual environment, `vehicles_env`, to manage dependencies like pandas, streamlit, and plotly-express—essential for data analysis and app development.
- **Tools in Action:** Use Visual Studio Code for seamless coding and git repository management.

## 📥 **Step 2: Data Acquisition**

### 🗂️ **Harnessing the Dataset**
- **Data Download:** Download and place the `vehicles_us.csv` dataset in the project directory. This will serve as the foundation for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations in the web app.

---

## 🔍 **Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis**

### 📊 **Insights at a Glance**
- **Jupyter Notebook Setup:** Create a Jupyter Notebook (`EDA.ipynb`) within a dedicated `notebooks` directory for preliminary data exploration.
- **Visualization with Plotly Express:** Utilize histograms and scatter plots to reveal data distributions and correlations, ensuring a solid understanding of the dataset.

## 🖥️ **Step 4: Web Application Development**

### 🌟 **Building the Dashboard**
- **Main Application File:** Develop `app.py` at the root of the project directory as the centerpiece of the Streamlit app.
- **Features at a Glance:**
  - **Library Integration:** Import essential libraries for functionality.
  - **Data Loading:** Read and prepare the dataset for visualization.
  - **Interactive Interface:** Craft a user-friendly UI with a main header and interactive buttons, enabling users to generate histograms and scatter plots dynamically.
